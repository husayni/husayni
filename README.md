👋 Hi, I’m Syed Hussain!

🚀 Senior Software Engineer with a passion for building scalable and efficient Machine Learning solutions. Over the last 4+ years, I’ve specialized in combining my expertise in Software Engineering and AI to create cutting-edge applications, solve real-world problems, and optimize systems for maximum impact.

💡 What I Do

As a Senior ML Engineer, I’ve had the pleasure of leading teams to develop powerful AI-driven solutions and ensuring product scalability across multiple projects. Some of my favorite challenges include:

	•	Architecting AI systems from scratch, with a focus on Computer Vision and Real-Time Processing.
	•	Integrating MLOps methodologies to improve collaboration between data scientists and engineers.
	•	Building ML pipelines for model training, finetuning and deployment.
 	•	Building GenAI applications utlizing 3rd party LLM Apis

🛠️ Tech Stack

Here’s what’s always in my toolbox:

	•	Languages: Python, Java
	•	Frameworks: FastAPI, Flask, Celery, Serverless Framework
	•	Databases / Message Brokers: Postgres, Redis, MongoDB, Kafka
	•	DevOps / MLOps Tools: Kubernetes, Docker, Terraform, ClearML, MLFlow, GitHub Actions
	•	Cloud Providers: AWS (Lambda, SageMaker, Batch, SQS, S3, ECS), Azure (Container Apps)


🔗 Beyond the Code

	•	🥇 Remotebase Hackfest 2021: Winner of First Prize!
	•	🎤 Seminar Talk: Delivered a talk at NED University’s AI Week on “Deploying Models in Production”.
	•	🎙️ Panel Moderator: Led a discussion on “Aligning Expectations and Reality in Machine Learning Projects” at Folio3’s AI Meetup.

 🌱 What’s Next?

I’m currently pursuing a Master’s in Artificial Intelligence at Cardiff University, where I’m diving deeper into the world of AI research, including cybersecurity and intrusion detection systems for in-vehicle networks.
